Toss doughnuts in the bag one at a time until they are coated evenly with powdered sugar.\n\nCinnamon Sugar Doughnuts — melt 2 tbsp CannaButter and 2 tbsp of unsalted butter in a small bowl. In a separate bowl, mix together your cinnamon and sugar. Dip both sides of the doughnuts in the butter and then both sides in the cinnamon sugar.\n\nGlazed Doughnuts — whisk together 2 cups powered sugar, ¼ cup milk and 1 tsp vanilla extract, until smooth. Set doughnuts on cooling rack and drizzle glaze over with a spoon.",
