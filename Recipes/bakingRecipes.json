If it hasn\u2019t, then start over; your cannabis milk was either too hot or too cold.\n\n2. Once yeast begins to foam, add in sugar, egg, egg yolk and cannabis butter. Mix until well combined. Next, stir in flour and salt with a wooden spoon until a dough begins to form.\n\n3. Place dough hook on the mixer and knead the dough on medium speed for 8 minutes. The dough should form into a nice ball and be slightly sticky. (If you don\u2019t want to use an electric mixer, you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8-10 minutes on a well-floured surface.)\n\n4. Transfer dough ball to a well-oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel. Allow dough to rise for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.\n\n5. After the dough has doubled in size, transfer the dough to a well-floured surface and roll out into a 14\u00d79 inch rectangle. Spread softened cannabis butter over dough, leaving a \u00bc inch margin at the far side of the dough.\n\n6. In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and cinnamon. Use your hands to sprinkle mixture over the buttered dough.\n\n7. Tightly roll dough up, starting from the 9 inch side and place seam side down making sure to seal the edges of the dough as best you can.\n\n8. Cut into 1 inch sections with a serrated knife or floss. You should get 9 large pieces.\n\n9. Place cinnamon rolls in a greased 9\u00d79 inch baking pan or round 9 inch cake pan. (I also recommend lining the pan with parchment paper as well, in case any of the filling ends up leaking out.) Cover with plastic wrap and a warm towel and let rise again for 30 minutes.\n\n10. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove plastic wrap and towel and bake cinnamon rolls for 20-25 minutes or until just slightly golden brown on the edges. You want to underbake them a little so they stay soft in the middle, that\u2019s why we want them just slightly golden brown. Allow them to cool for 5 minutes before frosting. Makes 9 cinnamon rolls.\n\n11. In the bowl of an electric mixer, combine cream cheese, cannabis butter, powdered sugar and vanilla extract. Beat until smooth and fluffy. Spread over cinnamon rolls and serve immediately.",
