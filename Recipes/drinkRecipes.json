Attach the nitrous charger to the whipper and then release the gas. Unscrew the charger and attach the second charge and release the gas again. After the second charge, let it sit for a minute or two and then open it up.\n\n3. Next, take out your double boiler. Heat the water in the lower part of the double boiler to around 200 degrees. Pour the infused alcohol into the top of the double boiler.\n\n4. Simmer the alcohol at this temperature in the top of the double boiler for about 45 minutes. It will reduce a bit, so add vodka to match whatever volume is lost in order to maintain the original volume.\n\n5. Next, remove the top pot from the double boiler and set aside. Using a glass-measuring cup, put a small metal strainer on top and then set some cheesecloth into the strainer. Pour the Cannabis liquid into the glass-measuring cup and strain out the leftover cannabis.\n\n6. After straining, add enough of vodka to bring it back to the original volume (250 ml).\n\n7. Now you can use this liquid, Green Dragon, as a substitute for the base spirit in your favorite cocktail.",
